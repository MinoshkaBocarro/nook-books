			<h1>About Nook Books</h1>
			<p>
				Nook Books is about creating a welcoming cozy space for all
				bookworms to browse books to their hearts content.
			</p>

			<p>
				I wanted to make browsing and exploring different genres
				effortless and harken back to the days when we trailed through
				the library shelves. When we judged a book by its cover and not
				its rating. Because I believe that reading is a pleasure, never
				a guilty one.
